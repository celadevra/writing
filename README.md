writings
========

Currently, I don't have a functioning blog or personal website. I have
given the idea of a website much consideration, and have decided that
the future I would thank the now me for systematically summarizing
abstract ideas and turning them into graspable texts. The future I
would be yet more happy if texts written by the now me earns
connections, leads, and even friends and partners along the way.

I have already created a log system using Org-mode. Previous attempts
to organize them using tags did not turn out well. Among other
reasons, org-mode tags are not supposed to be used in this manner;
tagging is not how I attach meanings to texts either. More promising
approach seems to be creating folders for each topic that I'm
interested in, and write notes under these folders (topics).

Tiago Forte's [progressive
summarization](https://fortelabs.co/blog/progressive-summarization-a-practical-technique-for-designing-discoverable-notes/)
approach might help me collect and review notes. But I think what
ultimately works for me would be the boring folder system, where many
resources, concepts and arguments about a certain topic are collected,
and meld into something somewhat coherent and actionable. I have no
proof right now it would work, but on this matter, no one can tell me
what is the best way either. I have to try things out and adjust as I
go.
