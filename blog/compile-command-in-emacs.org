The other day I learned from [[http://endlessparentheses.com/provide-input-to-the-compilation-buffer.html][Endless Parenthesis]] that there is a very useful =compile= command in Emacs that allow you to run any build tool as long as they can be called from the shell. You don't have to switch to a terminal to run them any more.

By default, when you 'M-x compile', Emacs calls =make -k=, the default compile command. This is usually what you want with codes with a =Makefile=. If you want to use your own compile command for a specific project, you can use the recipe from [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/CompileCommand][EmacsWiki]]:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (require 'compile)
   (add-hook 'c-mode-hook
             (lambda ()
               (unless (file-exists-p "Makefile")
                 (set (make-local-variable 'compile-command)
                      ;; emulate make's .c.o implicit pattern rule, but with
                      ;; different defaults for the CC, CPPFLAGS, and CFLAGS
                      ;; variables:
                      ;; $(CC) -c -o $@ $(CPPFLAGS) $(CFLAGS) $<
                      (let ((file (file-name-nondirectory buffer-file-name)))
                        (format "%s -c -o %s.o %s %s %s"
                                (or (getenv "CC") "gcc")
                                (file-name-sans-extension file)
                                (or (getenv "CPPFLAGS") "-DDEBUG=9")
                                (or (getenv "CFLAGS") "-ansi -pedantic -Wall -g")
                                file))))))
#+END_SRC

You can also set the compile command as a local variable:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  # -*- compile-command: "crontab ~/.crontab" -*-
#+END_SRC

So whenever you press 'M-x compile', the file's content will be inserted into the crontab.

The =*Compilation*= buffer shows the compile results, highlights errors, and even provide the option to jump to the error, which can be very handy combined with a REPL.
